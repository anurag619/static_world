    <p>Online shopping was never in a better state than in 2014 and will probably improve in the coming years. With the recent deal of Flipkart and Myntra, the ecommerce scene in India has improved a great deal. Everything brings more rejoice for the online customers. Personally speaking my online purchases have significantly increased in the 3-4 years. And why not as an online customer I tend to get more benefits as compared to the offline markets.</p>
<p>I live with few of my friends in Kolkata and we call ourselves as internet citizens. Majority of our time is spent in the internet world but at the same time we devote enough time for offline social interaction.
Coming back to topic, as internet citizens we make full use of our purchasing rights. You know the drill, getting coupons and discounts for every possible item.</p>
