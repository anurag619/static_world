  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Last weekend marked the end of yet another awesome PyconIndia. This was not only the best PyconIndia experience for me but also for many others who have been a regular attendee since past years.</p>
<p>As compared to last year, this time I choose to volunteer for the event which was an unique experience in its own. Although I missed the first keynote and few important sessions but I came to realized few key things, quoting from the presentation at PyconIndia, 'conference are more than just attending sessions'.</p>
<img alt="alternate text" class="align-center" src="/images/pycon_one.png" />
<p>Last year I was just hopping from one Audi to another, which was definitely not so great experience. You always have videos on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/inpycon">Youtube</a> to watch those sessions but the physical interactions with people is one thing you wont get after the event.</p>
<p>Between I was in the video team who shot the entire event, so cheers. :D</p>
<p>The panel discussion (Flask vs Django vs Web.py) on Day 2 was another delight, at then end of 45 minutes discussion, Django emerged as the clear winner. The votes were based out of an app made by <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/twitortat">Aravind</a> which calculated number of miscalls to numbers assigned to three frameworks. Here is a snapshot of the <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/twitortat/status/516263794352197632">votes</a></p>
<p>Food, like every year was the center of attraction, heck it was even better than last years. Whenever I tend to invite people for Pycon, food remains my primary source to convince them.</p>
<p>PyconIndia in general gets good reception from developers across the country and being a volunteer you get to know them much better.</p>
<p>For me sessions from <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Krace</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/anandology">Anand</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/jackerhack">Kiran</a> were feature of the PyconIndia 2014.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://campushash.com/">CampusHash</a> , finally launched their product at the event and I am waiting for the early invite.</p>
<p>I will leave you with these <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?v=stream&amp;q=%23pyconindia&amp;src=tyah&amp;mode=photos">images</a> from the event.</p>
