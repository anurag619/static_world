:excerpt: Starting with Pelican


Hi!

This is my first rst post! After dealing with different blogging platforms I found Pelican perfect suited to needs. Its simple and easy to install, start, host and overall its written in Python. I have found a new open source library to contribute to. Further all my codes and articles will be hosted on github, so worries of creating a backup of my local system files.
