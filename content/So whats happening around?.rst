I will forever wonder “What happened to craze for writing” 

I write one article every 2-3 months now when I used to finish the same in an hour. Where is the passion? I wonder if there was any passion in the first place.

This happens to be my post from the new Macbook, so cheers to that.

I decided to make this post unstructured. Broken lines/sentences, meaningless. 

I have not contributed to any open source projects for a long time now and I have no intentions in near future either. 

I dont feel the need to do so. I have adopted more of outdoor activities. But still end up sitting infront of laptop for long hours.

Found new writer and his site `Austin Kleon <http://austinkleon.com/>`_ ,strange name I don’t know how to pronounce that.

How I found him? Well, surfing. Thats how I discover new things and that is how I learned about blogging in the first place. 

I have not worked on any personal projects and nothing is in the pipline either.

I am getting a strong urge of taking a coffee right at this moment. So, I will leave.

This should be the point of living, do what you wish not because others are doing. That might answer the title of this unstructured post.
