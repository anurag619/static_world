Couples of minutes back I was watching `Internet Own Boy <http://youtube.com/watch?v=vXr-2hwTk58>`_ and I don't have any opinions or views, `Aaron Swartz <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz>`_ needs no introduction. My only advice will be go watch the documentary(if you haven't already).

The start of the post is little off the topic but the documentary made me realized one fact (there are many others) that I know so little of internet or information in general. At the age of 25 he was out there making a world better place for others. What am I doing at 23?

Well, I had no answers to my own questions.

When I was in 11th standard I dreamt of making this world better. Instead of just consuming what it has to offer giving things back to the society too, in whatever manner I am capable of. 

Along the lines, various personal issues took me away from it. I lost a very important person in my life and also lost a bit of myself. But I am here now (though not fully recovered ) at a stage where I can work on the same childhood dream. Now that I have a domain to concerntrate (that would be internet), I can narrow down my energies into it.

Am I capable enough?

Well, I would say No, not enough but Hey no one here is born perfect of fully capable but I can always learn and teach myself. And and that what the post is all about.
