This post should have been published on Day1 of 2015 but due to one thing or other I just kept avoiding it.

Now that the Chrome extension is published, let me give little background on the same.

There exists a `Similar <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picturemate-view-hidden-p/khmlalkcjmglpgdkmkmmgjcajahkoigj?hl=en-US&utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher>`_ tool which gives you same functionality and I was hooked on Fb for 2-3 hours. Browsing through random facebook users.

The only thing that pinched me was that these guys were asking me to share their extension with another, if I wish to use it beyond 7 days.

Now, I would definitely want to recommend this to other friends but why generating some secret codes. So, I decided to make one similar tool and give it to the users, for free and limit/condition what-so-ever.

The extension is pity simple to use and I would not go deep into the details, you just need to have a Chrome Browser.

Install it from the `Chrome web store <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sneak-peak/cpimjbpbkpggeiicmehlcnmdoecmfane>`_
