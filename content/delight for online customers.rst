Online shopping was never in a better state than now. With the recent deal of Flipkart and Myntra, the ecommerce scene has improved a great deal. Everything brings more rejoice for the online customers. Personally speaking my online purchases have significantly increased in the 3-4 years. And why not as an online customer I tend to get more benefits as compared to the offline markets.
