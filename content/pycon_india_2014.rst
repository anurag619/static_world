Last weekend marked the end of yet another awesome PyconIndia. This was not only the best PyconIndia experience for me but also for many others who have been a regular attendee since past years. 

As compared to last year, this time I choose to volunteer for the event which was an unique experience in its own. Although I missed the first keynote and few important sessions but I came to realized few key things, quoting from the presentation at PyconIndia, 'conference are more than just attending sessions'.

Last year I was just hopping from one Audi to another, which was definitely not so great experience. You always have videos on `Youtube <https://www.youtube.com/user/inpycon>`_ to watch those sessions but the physical interactions with people is one thing you wont get after the event. 

Between I was in the video team who shot the entire event, so cheers. :D

The panel discussion (Flask vs Django vs Web.py) on Day 2 was another delight, at then end of 45 minutes discussion, Django emerged as the clear winner. The votes were based out of an app made by `Aravind <https://twitter.com/twitortat>`_ which calculated number of miscalls to numbers assigned to three frameworks. Here is a snapshot of the `votes <https://twitter.com/twitortat/status/516263794352197632>`_

Food, like every year was the center of attraction, heck it was even better than last years. Whenever I tend to invite people for Pycon, food remains my primary source to convince them. 

PyconIndia in general gets good reception from developers across the country and being a volunteer you get to know them much better. 

For me sessions from `Krace <https://twitter.com/kracetheking>`_, `Anand <https://twitter.com/anandology>`_ and `Kiran <https://twitter.com/jackerhack>`_ were feature of the PyconIndia 2014. 

`CampusHash <https://campushash.com/>`_ , finally launched their product at the event and I am waiting for the early invite.

I will leave you with these `images <https://twitter.com/search?v=stream&q=%23pyconindia&src=tyah&mode=photos>`_ from the event.
