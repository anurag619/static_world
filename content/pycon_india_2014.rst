Last weekend marked the end of yet another awesome Pycon. This was not only the best pycon experience for me but also for many others who have been 
a regular attendee since past years. As compared to last year, this time I choose to volunteer for the event which was an unique experience in its own.

I will quote few lines from presentation at Pycon, 'conference are more than just attending sessions'.

Last year I was just hoping from one Audi to another, which was definitely not so great experience. You always have videos on Youtube to watch those sessions but the physical interactions with people is one thing you wont get after the event. Between I was in the video team who shot the entire event, so cheers. :D

Food, like every year was the center of attraction, heck it was even better than last years. Whenever I tend to invite people for Pycon, food remains my primary source to convince them.
