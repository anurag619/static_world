Hi, I’m Anurag and this is my blog (a.k.a logs). This About page will be a cluster of archives over the years. So, enjoy the timely changes.

I am updating this almost after a year. Lot has changed since then, for starters I don't write much.
I have started working as a frontend developer now. Python is not even my weapon now. :D
Frankly speaking I am bit of lost. Hopfully the next the write this I have some better things to pour.

For a long time I was meaning to set a blog (this isn't my first and probably won't be my last) but due to one reason or other things were getting delayed. But here I am all set to go.

I have deep interest in writing, though I am not excellent at it but I do my best. So, spare me if you are an english expert and find major error. I write blogs, codes(for fun) and at times professionally for money. I also draw at times and no! you won’t find any sketches here.
Earlier I used to work for a media company (as a writer), not anymore. Python is my favorite weapon (of mas-destruction :D ).
I don’t possess a professional camera and I don’t click but still you will find some pictures of everyday stuffs around me.
