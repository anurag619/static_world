Hi, I’m Anurag and this is my blog (a.k.a logs) . I am against all the rules the education mafia has imposed (which emphasizes more on marks(which comes from mugging) rather than creativity, skills and knowledge ).

Sometimes I write blogs, codes(for fun) and at times professionally for money. I also draw at times and no! you won’t find any sketches here.

Earlier I used to work for a media company (as a writer), not anymore. Python is my favorite weapon (of mas-destruction :D ).

I don’t possess a professional camera and I don’t click but still you will find some pictures of everyday stuffs around me.
