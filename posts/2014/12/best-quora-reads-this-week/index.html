    <h1 class="title"> Best Quora reads this week</h1>
    <p class=date> Sat 06 December 2014 </p>
    <p>Ok, so as the title suggests I have started this series of posts from quora. Now why would I do that? Well, staraight forward answer I wish to collect these awesome reads that comes across my Quora profile and I wanted a new topic to write about.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://qr.ae/qXtZL/">What was it like to grow up in India in the 1990s</a>
I am sure if you are a true Quora reader you would have seen this question many times. I bet you will smile reading the answer, only if you were born in the 90s.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://qr.ae/qXnpM">What are the biggest misconceptions that Indians have about India</a> - Well, if you were born in an average middle class family, this answer needs no explanation. Speaking of which, I am glad I will never join that league.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://qr.ae/qXnnW">What are some of the best travel and exploring places in India which are not overcrowded with tourists</a> - This answer prompted me to start this series in the first place. The post is bit longer I agree but she had to cover all on her list. I have visited few of these and hoping I will visit them in near future.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://qr.ae/qXv1f">I am hearing the packages of 1 crores and 75 lakhs these days in IIT campus placements Where are they made to do their work in the US or India</a> - I have no words for this, the answer explains it all.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://qr.ae/qXvue">If an IIT graduate does not get a job in the campus placements what are his options after graduation</a> - Again a post worth mentioning, brave heart and bold decision. He is my also profile to be followed this week.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://qr.ae/qXvEI">What is it like being raised by relatively uneducated parents parents who have no graduate degree and arent in a business of any kind but earn a nominal salary</a> - A inspiring post which makes me realize how sometimes we take things for granted and do not value them.</p>
<p>Saw this iamge on Quora itself. Dont we just love Calvin.</p>
