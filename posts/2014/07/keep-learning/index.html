    <p class=date> Sat 05 July 2014 </p>
    <p>Couples of minutes back I was watching <a class="reference external" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=vXr-2hwTk58">Internet Own Boy</a> and I don't have any opinions or views, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> needs no introduction. My only advice will be go watch the documentary(if you haven't already).</p>
<p>The start of the post is little off the topic but the documentary made me realized one fact (there are many others) that I know so little of internet or information in general. At the age of 25 he was out there making a world better place for others. What am I doing at 23?</p>
<p>Well, I had no answers to my own questions.</p>
<p>When I was in 11th standard I dreamt of making this world better. Instead of just consuming what it has to offer giving things back to the society too, in whatever manner I am capable of.</p>
<p>Along the lines, various personal issues took me away from it. I lost a very important person in my life and also lost a bit of myself. But I am here now (though not fully recovered ) at a stage where I can work on the same childhood dream. Now that I have a domain to concerntrate (that would be internet), I can narrow down my energies into it.</p>
<p>Am I capable enough?</p>
<p>Well, I would say No, not enough but Hey no one here is born perfect of fully capable but I can always learn and teach myself. And and that what the post is all about.</p>
