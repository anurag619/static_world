All my previous attempts were turning futile as the commits were getting stacked in a single PR (Pull Request). As I searched through Stackoverflow pages I realized I had to create different branches to request multiple PRs. Here are the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;You need to create a new branch at first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
git checkout -b new-branch-name
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Now you will have to select a previous commit from where you wish to make changes. This can be from the SHA where the original project was forked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
git cherry-pick SHA-hash-of-commit
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get SHA-hash of your commits from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
git log
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternativly you can even do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
git log --pretty=format:'%h'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to get all SHA-hash but you have to be aware which SHA-hash will work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Make the relative changes and push them (after git add &amp;amp; git commit):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
git push origin new-branch-name
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you can view the new branch from your Github profile, switch to it and make the pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead I found Fedora emergency screen staring at me. It looked something like this (there were few more lines there):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Welcome to emergency mode.
Use &amp;quot;systemctl default&amp;quot; or ^D to activate default mode.
Type “journalctl” to view system logs.
Give root password for maintenance:
(or type Control-D to continue)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a normal Linux user I tried entering the commands printed on the screen, also looked into the logs for further clue as what exactly went wrong. As I remember I was playing around with the Apache configuration and updated the file systems, day before yesterday. To my dismay any of the commands mentioned in the emergency mode didn't gave any clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching on the internet gave me some clues that I might need to boot from a live cd/pen-drive to work around. But the problem was that the fedora copy was inside my system. I found many forums which had incomplete solutions for the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last I headed for #fedora channel on IRC and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Renich"&gt;Renich&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to help me with the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following mentioned steps will also help you understand triggering of emergency mode on Fedora and possibly steps to resolve the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-causes-an-emergency-mode-to-appear"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What causes an emergency mode to appear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be many reasons for triggering of emergency mode such as improper shut down of system, power issues etc. Quoting according to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/15/html/Installation_Guide/ap-rescuemode.html"&gt;fedora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
When things go wrong, there are ways to fix problems.
However, these methods require that you understand the system well.
This chapter describes how to boot into rescue mode, single-user mode,
and emergency mode, where you can use your own knowledge to repair
the system
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oviously I did some nasty things with my system,it might be my system upgradation. But the good news is that you can figure out the real cause of the issue. All you need to do is keep your eyes open. Operating system (here Fedora ) tend to give us reasons for doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try pressing 'ctrl+d' to exit and see if there is an error message written. In my case the OS asked me to
do manual &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsck"&gt;fsck&lt;/a&gt; on the corrupted disk/file system. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
systemd-fsck[576]: /dev/sda1: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
systemd-fsck[576]: (i.e., without -a or -p options)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above error message showed me that /dev/sda1 partition needs manual fsck. Another search on the internet gave me &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/40112/how-to-run-fsck-on-fedora-18/"&gt;how to do fsck in fedora&lt;/a&gt; But unfortunatly that didnt solved my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solution-s-if-any"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution(s) if any???&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first solution can be following the steps written on the screen. One of them being 'ctrl+d'. Try pressing this again and again and you might resolve the issue. I tried this and I did saw the login screen couple of times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try rebooting; sometimes, it gets fixed just like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still stuck move onto the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;As per solution I need a manual fsck on my partition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ fsck.ext4 /dev/sda1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and type y for everything asked. What this did was to repair the filesystem to normal. Oviously I had no idea what was all 'y' for but hey! everything is learning experience, one day I might understand those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Another solution can be typing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
fsck -A
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in emergency mode and it might help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Don't just blindly copy paste the commands mentioned above look for the error messages. Your file system might be different as compared to mine. For example I had sda1 and ext4 while you might have ext3 or 2.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tecmint.com/what-is-ext2-ext3-ext4-and-how-to-create-and-convert-linux-file-systems/"&gt;difference between ext2 ext3 ext4&lt;/a&gt;
In my case sda1 partition got a bit screwed and it needed an fsck,look for your issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case steps 2 and 3 work out well for you, try a reboot and hopefully everything will be back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Information on the internet is scattered around and there isn't one tutorial which can you through the entire process. It tooks me quite some time to figure out the exact procedure and the below mentioned steps are the result of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume you have a previous knowledge of vim and its subsequesnt commands, if not this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/10/vim-how-to/"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; might help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="installing-apache-webserver"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing Apache webserver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sudo yum install httpd
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="configure-apache-to-run-your-local-website"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configure Apache to run your local website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browse to the end of file (you do not need to change anything else) and append the following at bottom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;
DocumentRoot /var/www/your-site-name
ServerName local.your-mysite-name
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add your site (folder) name to DocumentRoot and ServerName. For example in my case it would be /var/www/site and local.site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: whatever site/folder-name you are adding above, must exists. If its not create such folder. After adding the above, you can save and close the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
vim /etc/hosts
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Append the following to the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
127.0.0.1    local.your-site-name
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example in my case it will be: local.mysite. Now, save and close the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Start Apache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sudo service httpd start
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Check if apache is running or not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sudo service httpd status
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
ps -eZ | grep httpd
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to view the httpd processes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now access your site at the address you specified above, e.g. local.your-site-name .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  do not add www at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

My only advice will be go watch the documentary(if you haven't already).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the post is little off the topic but the documentary made me realized one fact (there are many others) that I know so little of internet or information in general. At the age of 25 he was out there making a world better place for others. What am I doing at 23?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I had no answers to my own questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in 11th standard I dreamt of making this world better. Instead of just consuming what it has to offer giving things back to the society too, in whatever manner I am capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the lines, various personal issues took me away from it. I lost a very important person in my life and also lost a bit of myself. But I am here now (though not fully recovered ) at a stage where I can work on the same childhood dream. Now that I have a domain to concerntrate (that would be internet), I can narrow down my energies into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I capable enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I would say No, not enough but Hey no one here is born perfect of fully capable but I can always learn and teach myself. And and that what the post is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

With the recent deal of Flipkart and Myntra, the ecommerce scene in India has improved a great deal. Everything brings more rejoice for the online customers. Personally speaking my online purchases have significantly increased in the 3-4 years. And why not as an online customer I tend to get more benefits as compared to the offline markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live with few of my friends in Kolkata and we call ourselves as internet citizens. Majority of our time is spent in the internet world but at the same time we devote enough time for offline social interaction.
Coming back to topic, as internet citizens we make full use of our purchasing rights. You know the drill, getting coupons and discounts for every possible item.&lt;/p&gt;

This drawback can be effectively removed if you use HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to build the mobile apps. This is where &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phonegap.com/"&gt;PhoneGap&lt;/a&gt; comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation page of Phonegap gives some instruction on how to install some dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Npm and NodeJS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;To install Node you need to install some dependencies such as c++/gcc, which is used in compilation of the former:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ sudo yum install gcc-c++
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then install node. You can either do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ yum install nodejs
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;or you can install it from the source files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a: Download the source code from the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ cd Downloads
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ tarnode-v0.8.15.tar.gz (change the versions accordingly)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ cd node-v0.8.15
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ ./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo make install
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f: Add the path in system, if its not present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ cd

$sudo vi .bash_profile
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;add these lines in the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
PATH = $PATH:/usr/local/bin

export PATH
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Now that you have node, installation of npm will be very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;get the source from Github&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;untar it, move into that directory and then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ ./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo make install
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ sudo npm install -g phonegap
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic" start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Phonegap should be installed now. Move into a directory where you wish to create a app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ phonegap create my-app

$ cd myapp

$ phonegap run android
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this moment if you have a mobile device connected to the system the app will be installed on the device itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why our Indian culture promotes the culture of job searching instead of creating jobs for others, why not create a company instead of opting for MBAs and post grad degrees? My parents like any all caring parents in India wants me to take up a job after I complete my B.tech, which is quite natural considering the fact that they have invested in me for many years and now they wish I should live a happy and peaceful life. This is what any parent will wish for his/her child, right ? Perfectly normal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why not the other way around? Like how interesting it would have been if had they asked me to create a company instead of looking for jobs. (By the way I had already created one and its shut down as well. poor me!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I examined the generations of my family history and no one had ever diverted from the searching-the-job attitude after college (I will be the first one perhaps). So, no one knows what its like there, this entrepreneurship is total mystery land for them. And people are afraid from stepping into unknown places. Perfectly normal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then how we could change things around? The first step might be : jump into the pool of entrepreneurship and inspire the others to do the same (one may not succeed in the first attempt, someday down the line you might win and then there will be no appetite for your hunger). This is a very interesting &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_herold_let_s_raise_kids_to_be_entrepreneurs.html"&gt;TED vedio&lt;/a&gt; which encourages people to create entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have made a start and I always energize my spirits by observing other young entrepreneurs making their mark in the world ex - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/varun067"&gt;Varun Agarwal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/deepakravindran"&gt;Deepak Ravindran&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And may be someday I will inspire others to take up entrepreneurship as a career option. But I have a long road ahead, one important message that I have learned from the past experiences :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using Samsung Galaxy Pro to connect to fedora 19 but it shouldn't really matter if you have a different device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eclipse toolkit, you have the option to run it directly on a device. It's rather quick to do so but the experience is same as that of emulator.  On your phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Enable USB debugging (modern android versions this is present as Developers Option ) as well as installation of apk from sources other than the market (in the settings &amp;gt; security option).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;In the AndroidManifest.xml file , add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
android: debuggable=&amp;quot;True&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to the &amp;lt;application&amp;gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Connect your device with your system via USB cable, then Open terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ adb devices
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you will get a unique id for the device attached. Keep a note of this id, we will be using this below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to add a udev rules file that contains a USB configuration for each type of device you want to use for development. In the rules file, each device manufacturer is identified by a unique vendor ID, as specified by the &lt;em&gt;ATTR{idVendor}&lt;/em&gt; property. For a list of vendor IDs, see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#VendorIds"&gt;vendor ids&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in as root and create this file: /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Use this format to add each vendor to the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
SUBSYSTEM==&amp;quot;usb&amp;quot;, ATTR{idVendor}==&amp;quot;0bb4&amp;quot;, MODE=&amp;quot;0666&amp;quot;, GROUP=&amp;quot;plugdev&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the vendor ID is for HTC, change it according to your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now execute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your device is now configured, when testing apps from Eclipse IDE select this device when prompted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other ADB uses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After step 4 above, type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ adb shell
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this will list the root contents of your phone. Next if you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ ls
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the files will be visible to you. Other operations such as: &lt;em&gt;cd, mkdir&lt;/em&gt; etc are also applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to know more about ADB operations type $ adb in your terminal, you will get all available commands to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first rst post! After dealing with different blogging platforms I found Pelican perfect suited to needs. Its simple and easy to install, start, host and overall its written in Python. I have found a new open source library to contribute to. Further all my codes and articles will be hosted on github, so worries of creating a backup of my local system files.&lt;/p&gt;
